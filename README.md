_This repository currently holds two python files (excluding the **requirements.txt** file)._

_Here is a summary of what is in each:_

- **svgd.py** 
  - _contains a kernel class as well as,_
  - _a Stein Variation Gradient Descent class that does the SVGD updates_
- **animate.py**
  - _contains a distribution class to get a simple MVN and its log-derivatives and,_
  - _fitting + animation logic_

_In order to generate the animation, it is enough to run animation.py._

_This may be extended to include more methods in the future, depending on my reading interests._
